- **About**: For information about features and capabilities

### Document Management
- Upload multiple PDF files
- Process documents with a single click
- View document statistics and insights
- Generate document summaries
- Export findings and analyses

### Conversation Management
- Clear, separate chat histories for general and document queries
- Ability to clear conversation history
- Export functionality for record-keeping
- Medical notes capability for annotations
